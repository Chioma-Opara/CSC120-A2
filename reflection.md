Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked: 
- It was helpful to break the assignment down into parts and list out everything I 
understood I was to do. 
- Print statements saved me one more! I ran into a bug when I tried running update_price in the resale_shop file.
Using print statements helped me trace that the error was from the computer.py file that had the update_price method.

What didn't work:
- Second guessig myself. I wasted time just wondering if I was right or wrong. I should have just gone ahead to try what I thought.
Then, I would have run into errors that would have allowed me ask specific questions.

Advice to future students: 
- Start the homework early and go to office hours. 
- Test your code with actual examples. My code didn't throw out any error messages at some point, and I thought everyhting was
woring fine. When I tried testing it, I realised that the update_price method wasn't quite working as expected.
